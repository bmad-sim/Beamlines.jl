# We can access quantities like:
qf.L
qf.Kn1 # Normalized field strength

sol = Solenoid(Ksol=0.12, L=5.3)

# Up to 21st order multipoles allowed:
m21 = Multipole(Kn21=5.0, L=6)

# Integrated multipoles can also be specified:
m_thin = Multipole(Kn1L=0.16)
m_thick = Multipole(Kn1L=0.16, L=2.0)

m_thick.Kn1L == 0.16    # true
m_thick.Kn1 == 0.16/2.0 # true

# Whichever you enter first for a specific multipole - integrated/nonintegrated
# and normalized/unnormalized - sets that value to be the independent variable

# Misalignments are also supported:
bad_quad = Quadrupole(Kn1=0.36, L=0.5, x_offset=0.2e-3, tilt=0.5e-3, y_rot=-0.5e-3)

# All of these are really just one type, LineElement
# E.g. literally,
# Quadrupole(; kwargs) = LineElement("Quadrupole"; kwargs...)
# Feel free to define your own element "classes":
SkewQuadrupole(; kwargs...) = LineElement(; class="SkewQuadrupole", kwargs..., tilt1=pi/4)
sqf = SkewQuadrupole(Kn1=0.36, L=0.2)
# Alternatively and equivalently:
sqf = Quadrupole(Ks1=0.36, L=0.2)
# Note that tilt1 specifies a tilt to only the Kn1 multipole.

# Create a FODO beamline
bl = Beamline([qf, sf, d1, Bn1, d2, qd, sd, d3, b2, d4], rigidity=60.0)

# Now we can get the unnormalized field strengths:
qf.Bn1

# We can also reset quantities:
qf.Bn1 = 60.
qf.Kn1 = 0.36

# Set the tracking method of an element:
struct MyTrackingMethod end
qf.tracking_method = MyTrackingMethod()
# EVERYTHING is a deferred expression, there is no bookkeeper

# Easily get s, and s_downstream, as deferred expression:
qd.s
qd.s_downstream

# We can get all Quadrupoles for example in the line with:
quads = findall(t->t.class == "Quadrupole", bl.line)

# Or just the focusing quadrupoles with:
f_quads = findall(t->t.class == "Quadrupole" && t.Kn1 > 0., bl.line)

# And of course, EVERYTHING is fully polymorphic for differentiability.
# Let's make the length of the first drift a TPSA variable:
const D = Descriptor(2,1)
ΔL = @vars(D)[1]

d1.L += ΔL

# Now we can see that s and s_downstream are also TPSA variables:
qd.s
qd.s_downstream

# Even the reference energy of the Beamline can be set as 
# a TPSA variable:
Δrigidity = @vars(D)[2]
bl.rigidity += Δrigidity

# Now e.g. unnormalized field strengths will be TPSA:
qd.Bn1

# We can control elements together using the deferred expression 
# type DefExpr. DefExpr uses closures to evaluate a parameter, 
# and is always evaluated when *pulling* a value from a Beamline.
# Let's use DefExpr to set the Kn1 of qf and qd together

Kn1 = 0.36
qf.Kn1 = DefExpr(()->Kn1)
qd.Kn1 = DefExpr(()->-qf.Kn1)

# The quadrupole strength values are set to anonymous functions 
# which "stores"/"encloses" the value of Kn1 in the evaluated scope.

# When getting a parameter which is a DefExpr from a LineElement
# or parameter group, the deferred expression is evaluated:
qf.Kn1 == 0.36 # true
qd.Kn1 == -0.36 # true

Kn1 = 0.3 # update local variable
qf.Kn1 == 0.3 # true: closure evaluated upon *get*
qd.Kn1 == -0.3 # true: closure evaluated upon *get*

# We can improve the performance of deferred expressions by 
# by passing type-stable functions:
g::Float64 = b1.g
b1.g = DefExpr(()->g) # Closure has inferrable return type
b1.BendParams # any gets from BendParams are now type stable


# Deferred expressions provide a "pull" way of controlling multiple 
# elements together: in the above example, the DefExpr stored in 
# qf.Kn1 is evaluated *at the time of getting*.

# An alternative way of controlling multiple elements together 
# is with a "push" scheme, where when setting the control parameter, 
# all dependent values are updated. Beamline.jl's Controller type 
# provides a way to "push" values LineElements, or other Controllers.
# Let's create a controller which sets the Bn1 of qf and qd:
c1 = Controller(
  (qf, :Kn1) => (ele; x) ->  x,
  (qd, :Kn1) => (ele; x) -> -x;
  vars = (; x = 0.0,)
)

# Now we can vary both simultaneously:
c1.x = 60.
qf.Kn1
qd.Kn1

# Controllers also include the element itself. This can 
# be useful if the current elements' values should be 
# used in the function:
c2 = Controller(
  (qf, :Kn1) => (ele; dKn1) ->  ele.Kn1 + dKn1,
  (qd, :Kn1) => (ele; dKn1) ->  ele.Kn1 - dKn1;
  vars = (; dKn1 = 0.0,)
)

c2.dKn1 = 20

qf.Kn1
qd.Kn1

# We can reset the values back to the most recently set state
# of a controller using set!
set!(c1)
qf.Kn1
qd.Kn1

# Controllers can also be used to control other controllers:
c3 = Controller(
  (c1, :x) => (ele; dx) -> ele.x + dx;
  vars = (; dx = 0.0,)
)

# And of course still fully polymorphic:
dx = @vars(D)[1]
c3.dx = dx
qf.Kn1
qd.Kn1

# Beamlines.jl also provides functionality to convert the Beamline to a
# compressed, fully isbits type. This may be useful in cases where the 
# Beamline is mostly static and you would like to put the entire line on 
# a GPU, for example.
